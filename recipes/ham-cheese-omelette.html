    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil </li>
        <li>4 slices deli ham, chopped into small pieces</li>
        <li>2 eggs </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives, divided</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ham and cook until browned and crispy, stirring frequently,
            about 7
            minutes</li>
        <li>Beat eggs with 1 teaspoon chives, salt, and pepper in a small bowl</li>
        <li>Pour egg mixture into the skillet; let cook for 30 seconds. Lift the edges of the omelet so that
            uncooked egg runs under cooked edges and comes into contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet
            to
            move uncooked egg.
            Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top and fold omelette in half.
            Flip and cook until egg is entirely set and cheese has melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute</li>
        <li>Slide onto a plate and sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon chives</li>
    </ol>
